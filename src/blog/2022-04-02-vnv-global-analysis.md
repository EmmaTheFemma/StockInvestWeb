<p>
    In the fear of them owning Russian and possibly some underlying asset getting revenue or having investments from Russia. Or at least that’s what I’m guessing.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    When I checked the top 70% of the companies I saw only 2,1% russian. So there could be more but nontheless worth an analysis.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    Let’s start by checking what holdings they own to better understand the company.
</p>

</figure>

<br>
<p>
    Here we clearly see that the company is pretty well diversified.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    From this chart it doesn't seem very likely that 50% of their holdings are russian.
    Since it's a swedish company so well diversified.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    And now we know what companies we should look at first. Lets go from biggest to smallest. Aka most important to least. Later down the road.
</p>

    <figcaption class="text-centered">
        <h2 class="mr-top">Net Asset Value</h2>
        <p>From: <a href="http://ibindex.se/ibi/#/company/VNV" target="_blank">Ibindex.se</a></p>
    </figcaption>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/HfFhNVr.png" alt="Max, low & Average NAV">
</figure>

<br>
<p>
    From their 2021 report the discount should be about 54% but according to Ibindex it’s  50%.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    If we check the calculated NAV we see that the stock trades average with a 15% NAV discount over the past 5 years. 
</p>

<br>
<p>
    So it’s on average discounted just not 50% as in today's stock price.
</p>

<h2 class="mr-top">Let's Find Russia</h2>

<br>
<p>
    But let’s find the Russian companies then what companies have any ties to russia.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    Got this info just by going to the company websites and wikipedia. Maybe not the best sources but hey the best I can do.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    Borzo is a Russian company. But works in some other countries. But as we see It’s only 2.1% Borzo in VNV Global.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    Gett serves in Russia but owned by UK. BlaBlaCar has some Russian, owned by france.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    HousingAnywhere doesn't seem to work in Russia but maybe did before the war.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    Olio has some Russian but when I tried to get some food it was not available in Russia. So I’m guessing it's not so popular over there.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    These are the companies I found ties with in russian. So 2.1% russian owned, 20.6% some russian, 2.1% Maybe. In total 24.8%. 
</p>

<br>
<p>
    I don’t know how much is actually from Russia but this makes me assume there’s way less then 24.8% russian I would not believe it’s even 10% Russia. I could be wrong.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    Maybe something even deeper is having connections with Russia but I sadly don’t know where to find that out.
</p>

<h2 class="mr-top">The Underlying Assets</h2>

<br>
<p>
    I also don’t know how to value all their underlying assets. So I’m mostly going to assume the valuations are somewhat correct and not 50% wrong.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    But if there’s something wrong in the underlying assets it could motivate the drop.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    I don’t find much Russian connections to motivate this massive price drop though.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    This is a very important part of investment companies to look at the underlying stocks but with the information being so hard to find and with companies I don’t understand I really can’t do much at this stage.
</p>

<h2 class="mr-top">Conclusion</h2>

<br>
<p>
    Well diversified company that has only 2.1% russian companies but a total of 24.8% could and do have some connections with Russia.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    Unclear how much but would assume there’s very little with Russia, if we look at all their investments as a whole.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    Many companies are unlisted so it is very hard to evaluate them, at least for me.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    The company is selling with a 50% NAV Discount. One of the biggest ones I’ve seen in an investment company.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    I do find this 50% NAV being very tempting and based on how these are valued and by whom this could be an extremely good investment.

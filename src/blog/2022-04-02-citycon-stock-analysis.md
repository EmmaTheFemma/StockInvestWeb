description: A real estate company that invests mainly in shopping malls is selling so low it's starting to get really interesting.

<br>
<p>
    This is why I think this company could possibly be very undervalued.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    One of the biggest reasons I believe that the stock has been sold so much is just because they have malls and people think malls are a dying breed. Because of the increase in online shopping
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Also, the value of their real estate has been decreasing. I just think the stock has been sold waaaay too much to motivate the current price.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    COVID-19 and quarantines have also impacted the faith in these kinds of properties. I would never personally go to a shopping mall in the middle of a pandemic.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    And all of these can be right, as you will see from the numbers in this analysis. But if we look at a longer period of time, it seems it has been doing pretty okey.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    What first sparked my interest was the fact that the stock is trading for far less than the value of their properties. Here is some data from their annual reports.
</p>

<div class="text-centered">

<p>
    <a href="https://quoteddata.com/glossary/epra-nav/" target="_blank">EPRA NAV</a>
    in short, meaning the valuation of the properties.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    If you buy the stock at the price of €6,95 EUR and divide it, by the 2021 EPRA NAV you get something like 0.58 so about 0.42 or 42% less than what the properties are valued at.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    I don’t quite know how to value real estate, so I’ve just assumed that
    <a href="https://www.epra.com/" target="_blank">EPRA</a>
    probably are not 42% incorrect in their valuation of the properties. 
</p>

<br>
<p>
    Tangibles are usually easier to somewhat correctly value (or at least what I think) and that’s why I don't just look at 
    <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-bookratio.asp" target="_blank">P/B</a>
     but for 
    <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tbvps.asp" target="_blank">P/B-tang.</a>
</p>

<br>
<p>
    I believe it's harder to say how much, let's say, an education will be worth, and easier to say how much a car is worth (and you can cash in on it sooner).
</p>

<div class="text-centered">

<br>
<p>
    Because of 
    <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyback.asp" target="_blank">Buybacks</a>,
    there are fewer stocks today than there were before. So I tried to take the NRI / ( today's amount of stocks) to create a more fair idea on the NRI instead of just looking at the shares at the time.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    And even before COVID-19 there was a decline in 
    <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/net-rental-income/" target="_blank">NRI (Net Rental Income).</a>
</p>

<br>
<p>
    Instead of using earnings (because they take into account the property valuation) we use NRI then we get a NRI/price of 5.8 
</p>

<br>
<p>
    The low P/NRI must be because they have been shrinking of late. But as we see in the graph, they have been growing just very slowly.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    So about a <span class="text-plus">24%</span> increase in 10 years or <span class="text-plus">2.25%</span> YoY increase.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    So people value it lower because it's expected to keep declining or growing very slowly.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    So we have a “P/E” of 5.8 while also owning assets that we bought <span class="text-plus">40%</span> less than what they are valued at.
    But at a very slow/nonexistent growth.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    I don’t see any hugh growth possibilities here. Unless they do some very good investments.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    I don’t believe growth is really necessary IF you buy it cheaply enough and the company is pretty stable.
</p>

<div class="text-centered">
    <h2 class="mr-top">Dividends</h2>
    <p>Year on Year growth</p>
    <p class="text-light">(per share)</p>
</div>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pU7pLvy.png" alt="Citycon Oyj Dividend 2012-2021 YoY" class="zoom">

<p>
    Dividends have been decreasing, but solely looking at the dividend ratio is not enough.
     But at the current share price, it's over 7% at the time.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    If we take <b>DIVIDEND / NRI</b> we get the % of the rent that we get in the form of dividends. 
</p>

<br>
<p>
    Only 42% of the NRI being distributed makes it very sustainable and with a possibility of a shit ton of increased dividends in the future.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    I don’t  really know what they do with the rest of the 58%, but I'm guessing very long-term investments and maybe some repayment of loans.
</p>

<div class="text-centered">
    <h2 class="mr-top">Equity Ratio</h2>
    <p>Year on Year growth</p>
</div>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/I94stnN.png" alt="Citycon Oyj Equity Ratio 2012-2021 YoY" class="zoom">

<br>
<p>
    As we see clearly, their own capital vs loans has been increasing over the past 10 years.
    By over <span class="text-plus">61%</span> since 2012 and that's a <span class="text-plus">4.91%</span> YoY growth.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    The loans are not so big, not the best I’ve seen at a real estate company, but not nearly the worst.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    With 52% of the company, that means that only 48% are loans and with that huge NRI, they must be able to survive higher interest rates.
</p>

<h2 class="color-special text-underline mr-top">Conclusion</h2>

<br>
<p>
    The <span>{{ date | postDate }}</span> share price of €<span id="citycon"></span> EUR.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    Citycon Oyj is selling for <span class="text-plus">40%</span> under the valuation of the real estate (EPRA NAV).
</p>

<br>
<p>
    Their Net Rental Income (NRI) is about 17% of the stock's price.
     With only an average YoY growth of <span class="text-plus">2.25%</span> for the past 10 years.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    The dividend is over <span class="text-plus">7%</span> with only 42% coming from NRI.
    Making it possible for an increase in dividends in the future and leaving the company with a lot of money left for re-investments and repayments of loans.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    Only 48% is loans. Making it have high survivability if interest rates rise because of this and their high NRI.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    If you buy this company, you will probably not see a huge increase in the share price. Unless they sell properties or increase their NRI. Would they sell all their properties at their EPRA NAV, the share price would probably go up around <span class="text-plus">60%</span>.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    But the high real estate discount, added to the high earnings from rents, low loans and a high sustainable dividend makes it very unlikely to lose money over time.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    And take into account the dividend we receive and re-invest it as well for a 
    <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compounding.asp" target="_blank">compounding</a> effect.
</p>

<br>
<p>
    Unless the shopping malls and all the other real estate they own become so useless in the future, which I also think is very unlikely.
